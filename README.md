Each of the .py files here contains the code for one of the presented Python libraries. For installation and initial setup, please check the Medium articles. 
The used angel statue mesh and point cloud can be found in the folders or can be downloaded as part of larger Photogrammetry datasets - [HERE](https://doi.org/10.17632/bzxk2n78s9.4) and [HERE](https://doi.org/10.17632/xtv5y29xvz.2)
The used dataset can be also downloaded from [HERE](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivannikolov/longterm-thermal-drift-dataset) and is a part of this [publication](https://vbn.aau.dk/ws/files/452153692/paper.LjjqegBNtPi.pdf)
